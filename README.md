Built a tool that checks the similarity of two sentences with the similarity score and are accessible via API


Take a sentence, convert it into a vector.
Take many other sentences, and convert them into vectors.
Find sentences that have the smallest distance (Euclidean) or smallest angle (cosine similarity) between them — more on that here.
We now have a measure of semantic similarity between sentences — easy!
